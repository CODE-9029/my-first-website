<h2>Video Games</h2>

<p>At the beginning, maybe it was simple control, excitement, tension and satisfaction that made me like a video game</p>

<p>Then, I put my effort into it and it really paid off</p>

<p>After that, I entered the world of this game</p>

<p>I (and my friends) got a memory for this. That is my (our) private world</p>

<h2>Animation</h2>

<p>The animation is a visual medium full of structure and narrative possibilities</p>

<p>Its true value lies in the realization of scenes and ideas that cannot be reproduced in the third dimension</p>

<p>It has real uniqueness, artistic value and endless possibilities</p>

<p>that contemporary youth cannot achieve in the gray and exhausted reality</p>

<h2>Piano</h2>

<p>When lonely, playing the piano is a way of self-communication</p>

<p>When in love, playing the piano is a way to express feelings</p>

<p>When thinking, playing the piano is a way to perfect yourself</p>

<p>But maybe I prefer to listen to your piano</p>

<h2>Fitness</h2>

<p>A strong body is the basis for a person to achieve his goals</p>

<p>An ambitious people is also afraid of not being strong</p>

<p>If you are healthy, energetic, thinking, and knowledgeable, what can't you do?</p>

<p>Not to mention that it can make you look better</p>
